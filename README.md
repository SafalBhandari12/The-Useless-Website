# üåø Plant-Disease-Detection
Plant disease detection is crucial for farmers to ensure healthy crop yields. This project leverages deep learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using the PyTorch framework, to classify leaf images into 39 different categories. The model is trained on the Plant Village dataset.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project on Your Machine
1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have **Python 3.8** installed.
2. **Setup Virtual Environment:**
   - Create and activate a Python virtual environment using this [guide](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Model Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `Flask Deployed App` folder.
   - Download the pre-trained model `plant_disease_model_1.pt` from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ewJWAiduGuld_9oGSrTuLumg9y62qS6A?usp=share_link).
   - Place the downloaded file in the `Flask Deployed App` folder.
5. **Run the Flask App:**
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
6. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - You can also experiment with the model in the `Model` section using Jupyter Notebook.

## üß™ Testing Images
If you don't have leaf images, you can use the test images in the `test_images` folder. Each image has a corresponding disease name to verify model accuracy.
